-problems with lightdm log in ( login loop )
-problems with driver istall ( "Driver Installation failed: it appears, that a X server is running..." )
To succesfully install a NVidia CUDA Toolkit on Ubuntu 16.04 64bit I've just had to do:
1) make a liveImage of Ubuntu on pendrive ( 8GB pen is enough ) - such a try will save a ton of nerves, before unsuccesfull install on your host linux system!!!
2) login on live session on pendrive ( "Try ubuntu, before install" )
3) add sudo user at live session:
	#sudo adduser admin	( #pass: admin1 )
	#sudo usermod -aG sudo admin
4) logout from live session, log in as #admin
5) download CUDA Toolkit from NVidia official site ( ~1.5GB )
6) change privileges for downloaded installer file ( DO NOT INSTALL AT THIS STEP! ):
	#sudo chmod +x cuda_X.X.run
7) switch to console view:
	#Ctr+Alt+F1 ( to switch on terminal view )
	#Ctr+Alt+F7 ( to switch from terminal view to graphical server )
8) at console view ( Ctr+Alt+F1 ) log in:
	#login: admin
	#pass: admin1
9) stop graphical running service:
	#sudo service lightdm stop
10) check if graphical server is off - after switching Ctr+Alt+F7 the monitor should be blank black, switch back on console view Ctr+Alt+F1
11) install CUDA Toolkit, with such configuration:
	#sudo ./cuda_X.X.run
	#( press 'q' for license read skip )
	#do not install OpenGL library
	#do not update system X configuration
	#other options make yes and paths as default
12) turn on graphical server:
	#sudo service lightdm start
13) log in as user ( if you automatically log in as #ubuntu at live session log out ):
	#login: admin
	#pass: admin1
14) check whatever nvcc compiler works with provided simple parallel vector sum at GPU Blocks:
	#save vecSum.cu and book.h at new files, compile and run:
	#/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin/nvcc vecSum.cu && clear && ./a.out
15) check printout - it should be similar to:
	0.000000 + 0.000000 = 0.000000
	-1.100000 + 0.630000 = -0.000000
	-2.200000 + 2.520000 = 0.319985
	-3.300000 + 5.670000 = 2.119756
	-4.400000 + 10.080000 = 5.679756
	-5.500000 + 15.750000 = 10.250000
	-6.600000 + 22.680000 = 16.017500
	-7.700000 + 30.870001 = 23.170002
	-8.800000 + 40.320000 = 31.519997
	-9.900000 + 51.029999 = 41.129967
16) if everything went well, do the same on your host linux system
P.S. Please note that it is not ideal tutorial, but works fine for me!
